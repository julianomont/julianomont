Hello, my name is Juliano Monteiro.

I am an IT enthusiast and have been working in IT for over 25 years. 

I have a degree in Telecommunications Engineering and in these last 10 years I worked for companies like Sprint, and T-Mobile in the IT area. 
I have also worked for Ericsson, Solectron, Flextronics, and Shell Oil Company.

In all these years I've worked with networks, systems administration, security, server backup, databases, ETL, and currently I work with automation and software development.

I'm expert in problem solving and solution design, and I like to learn new technologies and share knowledge.

Best Regards!
